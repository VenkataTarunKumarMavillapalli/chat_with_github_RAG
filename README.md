## ðŸ’¬ Chat with GitHub Repo

LLM app with RAG to chat with GitHub Repo. The app uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers to questions based on the content of the specified GitHub repository.

### Features

- Provide the name of GitHub Repository as input
- Ask questions about the content of the GitHub repository
- Get accurate answers using OpenAI's API and Embedchain

### How to get Started?

1. Get your OpenAI API Key

- Sign up for an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/) (or the LLM provider of your choice) and obtain your API key.

2. Get your GitHub Access Token

- Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token) with the necessary permissions to access the desired GitHub repository.

### How it Works?

- The app prompts the user to enter their OpenAI API key, which is used to authenticate requests to the OpenAI API.

- It initializes an instance of the Embedchain App class and a GithubLoader with the provided GitHub Access Token.

- The user is prompted to enter a GitHub repository URL, which is then added to the Embedchain app's knowledge base using the GithubLoader.

- The user can ask questions about the GitHub repository using the text input.

- When a question is asked, the app uses the chat method of the Embedchain app to generate an answer based on the content of the GitHub repository.

- The app displays the generated answer to the user.
